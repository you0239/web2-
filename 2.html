A pathologically shy man with a tender heart, Matthew’s broken spirit and zest for life is reinvigorated by his love for Anne. He is played by R.H. Thomson.<br><h3>Appearance and Personality</h3>
Matthew is a shy person and has stage fright. He was a quiet child and had a hard time making friends.<br> He goes to extraordinary lengths to retrieve Anne after she is sent away for something that she didn't do, even selling a pocket watch that had belonged to his beloved late brother to get train fare. 한글
