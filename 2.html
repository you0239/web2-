<h2><strong>Matthew Cuthbert</strong></h2><h3>CBC Biography</h3>
A pathologically shy man with a tender heart, Matthewâ€™s broken spirit and zest for life is reinvigorated by his love for Anne. He is played by R.H. Thomson.<br><h3>Appearance and Personality</h3>
Matthew is a shy person and has stage fright. He was a quiet child and had a hard time making friends.<br> He goes to extraordinary lengths to retrieve Anne after she is sent away for something that she didn't do, even selling a pocket watch that had belonged to his beloved late brother to get train fare.<img src="matthew.png" width="200">
